# Overview

This project simulates a a 2D eulerian fluid flow, and has a GUI for controlling parameters, boundary conditions and post processing for flow visualisations.

This project was built with SDL3 and IMGUI, they are required to build the project with the CMake file. I used Vcpkg manager to install SDL3 and used CMake and MinGW, G++ to build and compile on windows.

Built and tested with G++ on: 
- Windows
- Linux

# Examples

### Vortex shedding 

The classic Kármán vortex street casued by vortex shedding seen simulated by this program. Have to pick an appropriate reynlods number regime however. 

### Aerofoil lift generation
The pressure gradient and therefore lift force generated by the differential can be easily seen.

# Next steps
- Extending to 3D, this requires not insignificant rewrites but is just a level up of this project and is "simple" enough to do in the long term.
- Allow for the importing of custom geometry.
- Add GPU accelerated compute.
